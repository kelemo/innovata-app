What happened? Well, instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt, the Republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest, borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars, and family incomes dropped.  You know where we ended up. Except it wasn’t the end. As we have since our founding, Americans made a new beginning. You worked extra shifts, took second jobs, postponed home repairs... you figured out how to make it work.  And now people are beginning to think about their future again – going to college, starting a business, buying a house, finally being able to put away something for retirement. So we’re standing again.  But, we all know we’re not yet running the way America should. You see corporations making record profits, with CEOs making record pay, but your paychecks have barely budged. While many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet, you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America’s kindergarten teachers combined.  And, often paying a lower tax rate. So, you have to wonder: When does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead? When? I say now.
